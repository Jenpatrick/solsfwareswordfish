# Summary

This is a solenoid pusher assembly for the Worker Swordfish.

This assembly is compatible with the Flywheel The World solenoid (google them to get one). Compatibility with other solenoids is not guaranteed or implied.

**WARNING**
This is a one-way deal. If you start to install this, you're not going back. Make sure you have all the necessary expertise, tooling, and parts ready to go.

You will lose a good portion of your battery bay, so I would suggest using a stock mount battery.

(yeah, there's some cool recoil)

**Print Instructions**
The Solenoid Cage should be printed using a strong infill setting. I actually did mine at 100% with 0.1mm layer height (to ensure dimensional accuracy). The overhangs are critical, so I made sure I had a high % support, with a roof. You absolutely must get the overhangs flat.

The pusher nub can be printed at 100% infill using a strong filament. I use Polymaker Polymax. 0.1mm layer height, because there is an internal thread.

The template can be printed using whatever setting you want.

**Install Instructions**
It's coming.

**Wiring Instructions**
Well, this is largely up to you. I have seen solenoids installed as directly wired semi-auto setups, but I prefer an Arduino control.

**Help??**
Come check us out over at Making Stuff Awesome on Facebook.

**License**
Absolutely no commercial use of these models, firmware, circuit diagrams, etc are allowed. Blaster commissions featuring these models are not allowed unless authorized by myself in advance.

If you do not have access to a 3d printer, please contact myself, Flywheel The World, or you can use 3dHubs (or similar print bureau).
